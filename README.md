# My Android Portfolio

Hey! Thanks for checking out the source code for my personal portfolio app.

I built this because I wanted a way to showcase my projects and skills that actually demonstrates what I do—building native Android apps—rather than just hosting a static website. It’s written entirely in **Kotlin** and follows modern Android development practices.

## What's Inside

This app is basically my interactive resume. It covers:
* **My Projects:** A deep dive into the apps I’ve built (including this one).
* **Experience:** My professional timeline and education.
* **Skills:** The tech stack I work with.
* **Contact:** Quick links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.

## Under the Hood

Nothing too crazy here, just solid native development:
* **Language:** Kotlin (100%)
* **Architecture:** Standard Android Architecture
* **UI:** XML / Material Design
* **Build:** Gradle

## How to Run It

If you want to poke around the code or run it on your own device:

1.  Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Loki-apk/Portfolio.git](https://github.com/Loki-apk/Portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  Open the project folder in **Android Studio**.
3.  Let Gradle sync (it might take minutes).
4.  Hit the **Run** button and select your emulator or connected device.
